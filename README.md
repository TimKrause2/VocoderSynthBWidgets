## Description

VocoderSynth LV2 plugin is a Linear Predictive Coding based
vocoder with 3 selectable inputs: raw audio, a voice
controlled impulse and noise generator and a MIDI
controlled synth of impulse generators.

## Building Prerequisites

In order to build VocoderSynth you need these prerequisites.

- g++ and gcc
- libcairo2-dev
